= Quarkus Redisson Simplified Reproducer for issues faced while working on the Native Support for Camel Quarkus Redis Extension

This project should reproduce various issues observed while working on the camel-quarkus-redis native support.
It's base on mvn 3.8.1, openjdk 11.0.11 and GraalVM native-image 21.2.0.

Note that some issues may have been temporarily worked around in the last commits of the given branch:
https://github.com/aldettinger/camel-quarkus/tree/CAMEL-QUARKUS-2107-no-redisson-quarkus

== How to reproduce

Simply run `mvn clean integration-test -P native`.
The test runs fine in JVM mode while the static analysis fails in native mode.
